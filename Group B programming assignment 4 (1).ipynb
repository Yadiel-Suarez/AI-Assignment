    "We aim to solve the Eight Queens and Eight Puzzle challenges. Multiple instances of these problems are generated and solved using various algorithms, including hill climbing (both steepest ascent and preferred hill climbing), random restart hill climbing, and simulated annealing. A graph is created to analyze search efficiency and problem-solving success rates, comparing these results against optimal solution cost graphs. The final outcomes are then evaluated.\n"

    "II. Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "The proposed Exercise 4.4 requires generating and solving an Eight Puzzle and Eight Queens instance using hill climbing and simulated annealing strategies. The Eight Queens problem, first introduced by Max Bezzel in 1848 and solved by Franz Naunck in 1850, involves \"placing eight chess queens on an 8×8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other; thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal\" [1]. This exercise is described as \"a simple but nontrivial problem\" because it encompasses a broad range of computing concepts and demonstrates advanced problem-solving techniques. The solution relies on a recursive algorithmic approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving the problem using hill climbing involves a \"heuristic search used primarily for mathematical optimization problems in artificial intelligence... focus[ing] on finding the optimal solution by making incremental changes to an existing solution and then evaluating whether the new solution is better than the current one\" [2]. The algorithm is named hill climbing because it mimics the process of ascending a mountain. It consists of four main steps: initializing the state, identifying neighboring states, moving to a neighbor, and terminating when no further improvements can be made. Hill climbing is classified as a heuristic function since \"it ranks the possible alternatives at any branching step in a search algorithm based on available information\" [2].\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise utilizes three types of hill climbing algorithms. Steepest-ascent hill climbing follows the standard hill climbing approach but selects the most optimal neighbor rather than the first available one. The best neighbor is determined by assessing which node \"improves the state... offering the highest improvement (steepest ascent)\" [2]. First-choice hill climbing, also known as simple hill climbing, evaluates each neighboring node sequentially and selects the first one that provides an improvement over the current state [2]. Finally, random restart hill climbing, or stochastic hill climbing, incorporates randomness into the search. This approach \"selects a random neighboring node and decides whether to move based on its improvement over the current state\" [2].\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is also solved using simulated annealing, another optimization technique designed to find the best solution. The algorithm takes its name from metallurgy, as the process closely resembles physical annealing. The similarity arises because \"the 'heat' corresponds to the degree of randomness in the search process, which decreases over time (cooling schedule) to refine the solution... excel[ling] in escaping these local minima by introducing controlled randomness in its search, allowing for a more thorough exploration of the solution space\" [3]. The algorithm begins with an initial solution and a temperature parameter, where \"the temperature controls how likely the algorithm is to accept worse solutions as it explores the search space\" [3]. The process involves neighborhood searching, objective function evaluation, acceptance probability determination, and cooling schedule implementation. The algorithm continues running until \"the system reaches... no more significant improvements... or a predetermined number of iterations is reached\" [3]."

    "The analysis of the exercise was conducted using computational tools such as Visual Studio Code, Jupyter Notebook, and Python. The implementation was primarily based on the UC Berkeley code repository [4], particularly the search.py file and the GitHub repositary HYPJUDY/EightQueensAndPuzzle [5]. Theoretical principles referenced in the study are drawn from Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach by Stuart J. Russell and Peter Norvig."

    "IV. Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Various problem instances are randomly generated and written to a file. In the main function of each method, the file is read to retrieve an instance, which is then processed using the selected algorithm to solve the problem. The heuristic cost is defined as the number of queens attacking each other. The graphs for the analysis are then ones generated by HYPJUDY/EightQueensAndPuzzle [6].\n",
    "\n",
    "Different heuristic-based optimization techniques are implemented:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Steepest Ascent Hill Climbing: Evaluates the heuristic cost for all possible positions in the current column (i.e., moving a queen to another row within the same column).\n",
    "Selects the position with the lowest cost to minimize conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Preferred Hill Climbing: Selects a random position on the board and compares it to the current configuration. If the new position has a lower or equal number of conflicts, it is accepted. Empirical testing shows that allowing moves with the same number of conflicts significantly improves the solution rate.\n",
    "\n",
    ". Simulated Annealing: Similar to hill climbing but incorporates a probabilistic mechanism to escape local optima. A random position is selected, and if it has a lower conflict count, it is accepted. If the conflict count is higher, the move is accepted with a certain probability, which decreases over time, preventing the search from becoming stuck in poor local optima.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Each method executes a solution function within a predefined step limit. The expected number of steps required varies by method:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Steepest ascent hill climbing: Typically finds a solution or reaches a local optimum within 200 steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Simulated annealing: Solutions are generally found within 10,000 to 500,000 steps, with any execution exceeding 500,000 steps considered a failure due to time constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "A comparative analysis of 1,000 randomly generated test cases yielded the following observations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- All four methods achieved a solution rate exceeding 90%, with minor differences in success rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Preferred hill climbing outperformed the other methods in both efficiency and success rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Simulated annealing was the least efficient, taking significantly longer than other methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Steepest ascent hill climbing was effective but slightly less optimal than preferred hill climbing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Random restart hill climbing and simulated annealing were considerably slower, making them less practical for this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Preferred hill climbing was approximately 600 times faster than simulated annealing.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure solvability, instances were generated by starting from the goal state and applying a sequence of random moves (e.g., 5,000 moves) to shuffle the puzzle. Each method then reads the instance from a file and applies its respective algorithm to solve the problem, following a procedure similar to that used for the Eight Queens problem. [6]\n",

    "IV. Results\n",
    "\n",
    "The experiment demonstrates that while execution time remains comparable for the Eight Queens problem across different methods, success rates vary significantly depending on the optimization strategy. Both the random restart hill-climbing method and simulated annealing achieve resolution rates below 50%, while steepest ascent hill climbing and preferred hill climbing perform notably worse.\n",
    "\n",
    "This disparity arises due to local optima challenges in the Eight Queens problem. Given that an 8×8 chessboard has 56 unique random configurations, and that 92 unique solutions exist without considering transformations such as rotations and reflections, many configurations allow for improvement. However, the limited number of viable queen placements at any given step (typically between two and four) makes escaping local optima difficult. Moves often yield only marginal reductions in conflicts, leading to premature stabilization in suboptimal states. [6]\n",
    "\n",
    "Experimental results indicate that many board configurations become trapped on local peaks or plateaus, contributing to high failure rates. This suggests that when evaluating neighboring positions, viable moves rarely offer significant improvements. Furthermore, methods designed to avoid unfavorable paths often lead to stagnation rather than genuine progression toward an optimal solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The variation in performance among these methods stems from their fundamental properties. Steepest ascent hill climbing, though efficient, is overly aggressive and frequently converges to local maxima. Preferred hill climbing is excessively greedy, prioritizing immediate gains without long-term strategy. Random restart hill climbing, while intended to mitigate local optima, lacks sufficient direction and efficiency. Simulated annealing, though more exploratory, fails to produce consistently successful resolutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These findings underscore the necessity of a more refined optimization strategy, one that effectively balances exploration and exploitation while avoiding premature convergence."

    "V. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The experiment highlights the limitations of traditional optimization techniques in solving the Eight Queens problem efficiently. While hill climbing and simulated annealing provide valuable insights into heuristic search methods, their susceptibility to local optima significantly impacts their success rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hill climbing methods, particularly steepest ascent and preferred hill climbing, struggle due to their tendency to get trapped in local maxima, making it difficult to reach an optimal solution. Even with random restarts, the approach remains inefficient as it lacks a strategic way to escape unfavorable states. Simulated annealing, on the other hand, introduces randomness to explore the solution space more effectively, yet it does not always guarantee convergence to an optimal solution within a reasonable time frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "These findings emphasize the need for more advanced strategies that balance exploration and exploitation. Future research should investigate hybrid approaches that integrate multiple heuristics, allowing for a more flexible and adaptive search process. Additionally, adaptive temperature schedules in simulated annealing and dynamic state evaluation criteria in hill climbing could improve performance by reducing stagnation and enhancing solution refinement.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, while traditional optimization methods provide valuable foundational insights, solving complex combinatorial problems like the Eight Queens challenge requires innovative search methodologies that can navigate large solution spaces efficiently without being hindered by local optima."
